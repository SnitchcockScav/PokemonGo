package main

fmt, come back!

Program learned main() {
    I choose you, pikachu to be "green"
    Mime Jr use print pikachu
    Forretress use j := 0; j <= 5; j++ {
        Mime Jr use print j
    }
    I choose you, shinx to be 11
    What will Program do? shinx < 5 {
        Mime Jr use print "shinx is less than 5"
    } It wasn't very effective... Try shinx > 12 {
        Mime Jr use print "shinx is greater than 12"
    } Gotta catch em all! {
        Mime Jr use print "shinx couldn't figure out the number"
    }
}
